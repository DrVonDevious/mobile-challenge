# TOTVS Labs Coding Challenge - Mobile
Our React-native coding challenge is an app to create a simple product catalog. Where a user can login using *their* google account, see a list of existing products, add a new product *by* taking a picture using the camera *on their* phone, edit a product and remove it.

```
Important: Please make sure you use ReactNative and Redux. 
Check your solution into github with a readme.md file detailing instructions 
on how to get the app up and running..
```

# Main Features of the app

### 1) Signup and Authentication
Users should be able to login/signup using their Google account.

### 2) Create a product
Users should be able to create a new product by informing:
- Name

- Picture (here the user should be able to use their phone's camera for a new picture or use an existing picture on their phone)

### 2) Product List

Users should be able to see a list of all existing products in the catalog. The list should present the name and picture of the product.

### 3) Delete a Product
